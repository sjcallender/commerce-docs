# Order Model
Whenever you’re dealing with an order or cart in your template, you’re actually working with an `Commerce_OrderModel` object.

## Simple Output

Outputting an `Commerce_OrderModel` object in yout template without attaching a property or method will return the order’s [short number](#shortnumber):

```
Order Number: {{ order }}
```

# Overview

Order models are both carts and orders. They are the same thing. A cart just has it’s `isCompleted` property set to false.

Usually you will be working with an order model in your template in 2 situations.

1. When you are working with the active cart of the current customer.
```
{% set cart = craft.commerce.carts.cart %}
```

2. When working with completed orders.
```
{% set pastOrders = craft.orders.customer(craft.commerce.customer).isCompleted(true).all() %}`
{% for order in pastOrders %}
	Order Number: {{ order.shortNumber }}<br>
	Order Total: {{ order.totalPrice }}<br><br>
{% endfor %}	
```
